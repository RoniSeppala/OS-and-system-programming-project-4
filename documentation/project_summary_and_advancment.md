# Project advancement
## Beginning
The project was started with creating a README.md and documentaion folder

The environment required a bit of extra setup this time. an older version of gcc was required to get the source to compile and qemu installation was required to emulate the code. I went with gcc-9, which worked.

After getting the source and doing the intitial compile and emulation, the running of the stock project was confirmed
